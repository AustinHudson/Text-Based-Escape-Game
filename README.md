# Text-Based-Escape-Game
A text-based escape game where the player's choices decide the events that unfold in the game and whether or not they are able to escape. 


## Game Description 

The player awakens to find themselves on the beach of an unfamiliar island. 
The main part of the game unfolds in a 7 room house where the player must 
gather the necessary resources to repair a radio to call for help. The player's
choices affect the events that happen in the game and will ultimately decide whether 
or not they make it off the island. 

## How to Play
